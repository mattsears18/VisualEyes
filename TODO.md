# TODO

1. Need to change all (most) references from stimulusId to aoiId when creating visits.

2. Display fixation statistics so that I can make inferences about the fixation filter algorithm settings (e.g. from SMI)

   - minimum fixation duration
   - maximum fixation duration
   - average fixation duration
   - fixation count

3. Provide the ability to set a minimum fixation duration, which allows you to filter out short fixations, even if the original fixation filter used a shorter minimum fixation duration.
